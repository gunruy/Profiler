# Unity Runtime Profiler Monitor

This is a lightweight in-game profiler display for Unity that shows real-time performance data using Unity’s built-in `UnityEngine.Profiler` API.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time FPS display  
- Memory usage (allocated, reserved, Mono heap)  
- Garbage Collector info  
- Draw calls and rendered objects count  
- Simple overlay UI (left-top corner of screen)  
- Works in both 3D and VR projects  
- Only active in Developer Builds

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Add an empty `GameObject` to your scene.
2. Rename it to `Profiler` (optional but recommended).
3. Attach the `Profiler.cs` script to the object as a component.
4. Enter Play Mode — performance stats will appear on the top-left of the screen.

> ℹ️ This profiler is automatically disabled in non-development builds.
